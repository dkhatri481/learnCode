#### learnCode ::

This website theme is inspired from an [Ubumtu](https://help.ubuntu.com) help documentation website <br>
I would add some feature such as darkmode and responsive - contents :: <br>
<br>
Currently this is a static page with some html, css and javasript, I would publish this page in future
with php and mysql database, I prefer this webstie to everyone who want to learn-Code from basic to advanced.
<br>
This website have three diffrent page catagries to understand, for an easy way. <br>
Fist it have an index content to jump in servel pages. Second, well written wiki-documentation for additional imformation include refereces and third, pop-up window links without open the another page.
<br>
#### some future update for this website ::
[] download and pdf note
[] easy copy paste code
[] !impartant Notification
[] darkmode
